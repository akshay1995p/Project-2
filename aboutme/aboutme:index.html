<p>One of my many interests are computers, I love anything to do with computers. Traveling is something that brings a lot of importance to me. I have been fortunate enough to travel many countries across the world and many cities. I think the knowledge that you gain from traveling is just incredible. Sports are very fascinating and relaxing for me. Takes the pressure off my academics and itâ€™s a good energy booster.
