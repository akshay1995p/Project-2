<p>Hello, my name is Akshay Patel, this is the website for my ITMD 361 class. I transferred out from COD and Iâ€™m looking to really learn some skills in web development. I was born in India but mostly raised in Chicago, Illinois. Currently living in the western suburban neighborhood and love it there. I have many various hobbies and interest that keep me going throughout my days.
